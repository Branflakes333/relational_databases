**ER Model Reasoning**
I made the respective ID in each table the primary key because it is unique for every row. I decided to make all decisions treating Users as the "core" of the database because Users are the ones who buy/sell which is the cornerstone of the model. The result of this is no foreign keys in Users table. The foreign keys that refer to Users are Reviews and Products. ReviewID is a primary key and a foreign key relating to Users.Name because I am assuming reviews will have a listed author, and that author name is the Users.Name. Products are simplly ProductID to UserID since Users are the ones that put products up for sale.
The other foreign keys that don't rely of Users (directly) are Orders and Payments. For Payments, The amount refers to the Orders.TotalAmount since the payment is for the order. In Orders, TotalAmount refers to Products. Price because the products have a listed amount, and the orders need that info to total up.
